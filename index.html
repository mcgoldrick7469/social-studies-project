        <h1>Effects of Water Boarding</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding">Waterboarding is a form of torture in which water is poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immoblilized captive, cauing the person to experience the sensation of drowning</a>" this is what wikipedia defines waterboarding as. Just from this sentence alone it is clear that waterboarding is something you never want to experence, and thats why I will talk about it here so you can know what it feels like without having that experence</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>So lets say you wanted to waterboard some one, how would you do it? Well first off you need to bind the victim, then you would put a cloth over their mouth. Then all you do is pour water, but not enough to kill them. Then for some reason this causes there body to start reacting as if they were drowing. But this is all hypothetical of course.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>So now lets talk about how this is bad and horrible, for muiltiple reasons. first off subjecting someone to drowing and not dying and the likey hood of it happening again should fall under cruel and unsual punishment. second off it's not very hard to imagine that the effects on the victim and that it most likey will have given them hydrophobia. so it's quite obvoius that waterboarding is torture and if your not convenced here is a article about a personal account of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/08/hitchens200808">it</a>. </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>to conclude this disterbing dive into waterboarding, it is torture period. but it also easy too see how it's not, you could say "you can torture someone with damp cloth?" and it does look like that from the outside but hopefully this has changed your opinion.</p>
